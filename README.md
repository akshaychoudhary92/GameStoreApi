# GameStoreApi
This project involves creating a simple database backed REST inventory management web service for a Video Game Store using Agile development techniques in a solo setting. Responsibilities include designing and documenting the REST API and implementing the controller, service, layer, DAO, Java data objects, Spring Security and deployed it on PWS and unit tests for the application based on an existing database structure.
Its kinda basic for an APi Working on another one where it has edge services and its configs are on the cloud. Also making a pipeline for deployment. Stay tuned!
